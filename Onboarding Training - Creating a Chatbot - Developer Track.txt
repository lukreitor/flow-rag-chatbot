Onboarding Training Guide: Chatbot with RAG and Document Upload
Introduction to the Chatbot Project
Welcome to the Chatbot project! Our goal is to build a conversational AI application that leverages the power of GenAI to provide helpful and informative responses. This chatbot will have a React-based frontend for user interaction, a Python/FastAPI backend to handle logic and API calls, and will integrate with CI&T Flow's GenAI APIs for natural language processing. We'll be using a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approach, which means the chatbot will use a knowledge base of documents to provide more accurate and context-aware answers. This involves retrieving relevant information from the documents and feeding it to the GenAI model along with the user's query. The chatbot will also support optional document uploads, allowing users to provide additional context for the GenAI model.
Considerations:
What are the key components of a chatbot application? What are the benefits of using a RAG approach with GenAI? How does document upload enhance the chatbot's capabilities?
Creating the Python Backend and Learning the CI&T Flow APIs
Setting up the backend environment:
Let's set up our backend development environment. You'll need to have Python installed. It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies for this project. You can create a virtual environment using python -m venv venv and activate it using source venv/bin/activate (on Linux/macOS) or venv\Scripts\activate (on Windows). Once the virtual environment is activated, you can install the necessary packages using pip.
Considerations:
What are the benefits of using virtual environments? How do you manage dependencies in Python projects?
Creating a new FastAPI application:
We'll use FastAPI to create our backend application. FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. Install FastAPI using pip install fastapi uvicorn. Create a new file called main.py and add the basic FastAPI application structure.
Considerations:
What are the advantages of using FastAPI? How does FastAPI handle routing and request handling?
Reviewing the CI&T Flow API documentation:
Familiarize yourself with the CI&T Flow API documentation. The documentation provides information about the available endpoints, request parameters, and response formats. Pay close attention to the authentication requirements and the data structures used for interacting with the GenAI APIs. The documentation can be found at: https://flow.ciandt.com/docs/category/developer-portal/llm-api and https://flow.ciandt.com/ai-orchestration-api/swagger
Considerations:
What are the key endpoints available in the CI&T Flow API? How do you authenticate with the CI&T Flow API?
Before implementing the configuration file reading logic, define unit tests:
Before we implement the configuration file reading logic, let's define unit tests to verify that the API token and RAG documents folder path are read correctly from the configuration file. This will help us ensure that our code is working as expected and that we can easily test changes in the future. Use pytest to create the tests.
Considerations:
What are the benefits of writing tests before code? How do you write effective unit tests?
Implementing configuration file reading logic:
Implement the configuration file reading logic using a library like python-dotenv. Create a .env file in the root of your project and add the API token and RAG documents folder path to the file. Use the python-dotenv library to read the values from the .env file and store them in variables. Ensure that the implementation passes the previously defined unit tests.
Considerations:
How do you handle environment variables in Python? What are the different ways to store configuration data?
Research Content Suggestion:
* Explore different Python web frameworks (e.g., Flask, Django).
* Research different methods for managing environment variables and secrets in production.
* Investigate different testing frameworks and assertion libraries for Python (e.g., unittest, pytest-mock).
Connecting Backend to CI&T Flow
Establishing a successful connection to the CI&T Flow APIs:
Let's establish a connection to the CI&T Flow APIs. You'll need to use the API token that you stored in the configuration file. Use a library like requests to make HTTP requests to the CI&T Flow APIs.
Considerations:
What are the different ways to make HTTP requests in Python? How do you handle authentication when making API calls?
Making simple API calls to CI&T Flow and validating the connection:
Make a simple API call to the CI&T Flow APIs, such as a health check endpoint, to validate the connection. Verify that the API returns a successful response and that the response data is in the expected format.
Considerations:
What are the different HTTP status codes? How do you handle errors when making API calls?
Before implementing the connection logic, define unit tests:
Before we implement the connection logic, let's define unit tests to verify that the connection to the CI&T Flow APIs is established successfully and that the health check endpoint returns the expected response. This will help us ensure that our code is working as expected and that we can easily test changes in the future.
Considerations:
What are the different types of tests you can write for API connections? How do you mock API responses in your tests?
Implement the connection logic:
Implement the connection logic using the requests library. Create a function that takes the API token as input and returns a connection object. Handle any potential connection errors and ensure that the function returns a valid connection object. Ensure that the implementation passes the previously defined unit tests.
Considerations:
How do you handle connection errors in Python? What are the different ways to retry failed API calls?
Research Content Suggestion:
* Explore different HTTP client libraries for Python (e.g., aiohttp, httpx).
* Research different methods for handling API authentication (e.g., OAuth, JWT).
* Investigate different testing strategies for API integrations (e.g., contract testing, integration testing).
Document Loading, Parsing, and RAG Implementation (Including Uploaded Documents)
Reading the path to the document folder from the configuration file:
Let's start by reading the path to the document folder from the configuration file. You should have already implemented the logic for reading configuration files. Use the same logic to read the path to the document folder.
Considerations:
How do you handle different file paths in different operating systems? What are the best practices for storing file paths in configuration files?
Implementing API endpoint for document uploads:
Implement an API endpoint that receives documents uploaded from the UI. This endpoint will handle the file upload process. Consider using a library like python-multipart to handle file uploads in FastAPI.
Considerations:
How do you handle file uploads in FastAPI? What are the security considerations for file uploads?
Before implementing the document loading logic, define unit tests:
Before we implement the document loading logic, let's define unit tests to verify that the documents are loaded correctly. This will help us ensure that our code is working as expected and that we can easily test changes in the future. Consider tests for loading text files, loading PDF files, handling missing files, handling invalid file types, and handling uploaded files.
Considerations:
What are the different types of tests you can write for document loading? How do you handle different file formats in your tests? How do you test file upload functionality?
Loading documents (text and PDF files) from the folder using LangChain:
Load documents (text and PDF files) from the folder using LangChain. LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. Use LangChain's document loaders to load the documents from the specified folder.
Considerations:
What are the different document loaders available in LangChain? How do you handle different document encodings?
Loading uploaded documents using LangChain:
Load documents uploaded through the API endpoint using LangChain. Ensure that the uploaded documents are handled securely and efficiently.
Considerations:
How do you handle uploaded files in LangChain? What are the security considerations for handling uploaded files?
Before implementing the document parsing logic, define unit tests:
Before we implement the document parsing logic, let's define unit tests to verify that the documents are parsed correctly. This will help us ensure that our code is working as expected and that we can easily test changes in the future. Consider tests for extracting text from text files, extracting text from PDF files, handling different document structures, and handling uploaded files.
Considerations:
What are the different types of tests you can write for document parsing? How do you handle different document structures in your tests?
Implementing basic document parsing using LangChain:
Implement basic document parsing using LangChain. Use LangChain's text splitters to split the documents into smaller chunks. A useful tutorial on RAG implementation with LangChain can be found here: https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/rag/
Considerations:
What are the different text splitters available in LangChain? How do you choose the appropriate text splitter for your documents?
Receiving messages from the UI (via API endpoint):
Implement an API endpoint that receives messages from the UI. This endpoint will be used to receive user queries.
Considerations:
How do you handle different HTTP methods in FastAPI? How do you validate user input in your API endpoints?
Applying the RAG technique: creating embeddings for the user's query, retrieving relevant document chunks based on similarity:
Apply the RAG technique. Create embeddings for the user's query and retrieve relevant document chunks based on similarity. Use LangChain's embeddings and vector stores to implement this functionality.
Considerations:
What are embeddings? How do you create embeddings for text? What are vector stores? How do you measure the similarity between embeddings?
Research Content Suggestion:
* Explore different document loaders and text splitters in LangChain.
* Research different embedding models and vector stores.
* Investigate different techniques for improving the accuracy of RAG.
Creating the React UI Foundation
Development Environment Setup:
Before we start coding, let's set up our development environment. You'll need to have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows us to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, and npm (or yarn) is a package manager that helps us install and manage dependencies. You can download Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org/. After installing Node.js, you can verify that it's installed correctly by running node -v and npm -v (or yarn -v) in your terminal. Next, choose an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that you're comfortable with. Popular choices include VS Code, WebStorm, and Sublime Text. VS Code is a free and open-source IDE that has excellent support for React development.
Considerations:
What are the advantages and disadvantages of different IDEs? How do you verify that Node.js and npm are installed correctly?
Creating a React Application:
We'll use create-react-app (or Vite) to quickly scaffold a new React project. create-react-app is a command-line tool that sets up a basic React project with all the necessary configurations. To create a new project, run npx create-react-app chatbot-ui (or use the equivalent Vite command). Once the project is created, navigate to the project directory using cd chatbot-ui. We'll also need to install a testing framework. Jest is a popular choice that comes pre-configured with create-react-app. Alternatively, you can use Mocha with Chai. To install Mocha and Chai, run npm install --save-dev mocha chai.
Considerations:
What are the pros and cons of using create-react-app vs. other methods? What are the key features of Jest and Mocha?
TDD - Defining Unit Tests for the Text Input Field:
Now, let's practice Test-Driven Development (TDD). Before we write any code for the text input field component, we'll define unit tests that specify how the component should behave. This helps us ensure that our code meets the requirements and is well-tested. Create a new file called TextInput.test.js (or similar) in the src directory. Here are some example tests you can write:


* Test: The input field renders correctly (e.g., it's present in the DOM).
* Test: The input field accepts text input (e.g., the onChange event handler updates the input value).
* Test: The input field has a specific placeholder text.
Considerations:
What are the benefits of writing tests before code? How do you write effective unit tests? What are the key assertions to use in these tests?
Implementing the Basic UI Structure (TDD):
Now that we have our unit tests, let's implement the text input field component. Create a new file called TextInput.js (or similar) in the src directory. Write the code for the component, ensuring that it passes the unit tests you defined earlier. You'll need to use React's useState hook to manage the input value. Also, implement the chat history display area. This can be a simple div element that displays a list of messages. Add a button or drag-and-drop area for users to upload documents.
Considerations:
How do you structure your React components? How do you use CSS to style the UI? How do you implement a file upload button in React?
TDD - Defining Unit Tests for Message Sending and Document Upload Functionality:
Before implementing the message sending and document upload functionality, let's define more unit tests. These tests will verify that the message is added to the chat history when the user presses Enter or clicks a send button, that the input field is cleared after sending the message, and that the selected document is sent to the backend when the user uploads a file. Add these tests to your TextInput.test.js file.
Considerations:
How do you simulate user input in your tests? How do you test asynchronous operations? How do you test file uploads in React?
Implementing Message Sending and Document Upload Functionality:
Implement the message sending and document upload functionality. You'll need to handle the onSubmit event of the form or the onClick event of a send button. When the event is triggered, send the message and/or the uploaded document to the backend API. Use the useState hook to manage the chat history.
Considerations:
How do you handle user input events in React? How do you update the chat history dynamically? How do you send files to the backend using the Fetch API or Axios?
Introduction to React State Management:
React's useState hook is a fundamental tool for managing component state. It allows you to declare a state variable and a function to update that variable. For example: const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]); This creates a state variable that is initialized to an empty array. The setMessages function can be used to update the messages array. When you call setMessages, React will re-render the component with the new state.
Considerations:
What are the different ways to manage state in React? When should you use useState vs. other state management solutions?
Research Content Suggestion:
* Deepen your understanding of React state management with Context API or Redux.
* Explore different approaches to handling asynchronous operations in React (e.g., async/await, Promises).
* Investigate different UI testing strategies (e.g., end-to-end testing with Cypress, integration testing with React Testing Library).

Appendices (Optional Content)
Appendix A: Writing Effective Unit Tests
What is Unit Testing?
Unit testing is a software testing method where individual units or components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of an application.
Benefits of Unit Testing:
Early Bug Detection:
Unit tests help identify bugs early in the development cycle, making them easier and cheaper to fix.
Improved Code Quality:
Writing unit tests forces you to think about the design of your code and how it will be used, leading to better code quality.
Increased Confidence:
Unit tests give you confidence that your code is working correctly, allowing you to make changes and refactor with less fear of introducing bugs.
Faster Development:
While it may seem counterintuitive, unit tests can actually speed up development by reducing the amount of time spent debugging.
Test-Driven Development (TDD):
TDD is a software development process where you write the unit tests before you write the code. This forces you to think about the requirements and design of your code before you start implementing it.
TDD Cycle:
1. Write a test: Write a unit test that fails because the code doesn't exist yet.
2. Run the test: Verify that the test fails.
3. Write the code: Write the minimum amount of code necessary to make the test pass.
4. Run the test: Verify that the test passes.
5. Refactor: Refactor the code to improve its design and readability, while ensuring that all tests still pass.
Test Doubles (Mocks, Stubs, Spies):
When unit testing, you often need to isolate the unit of code you're testing from its dependencies. This can be achieved using test doubles, which are objects that replace real dependencies in your tests.
Mocks:
Objects that simulate the behavior of real objects and allow you to verify that certain methods were called with specific arguments.
Stubs:
Objects that provide predefined responses to method calls, allowing you to control the behavior of dependencies.
Spies:
Objects that record information about how they are used, such as how many times a method was called and what arguments were passed.
Code Coverage:
Code coverage is a metric that measures the percentage of your code that is covered by unit tests. While high code coverage is not a guarantee of code quality, it can be a useful indicator of how well your code is tested.
Example (Python with pytest):
  

Key Takeaways:
* Write unit tests for all of your code.
* Use TDD to guide your development process.
* Use test doubles to isolate your code from its dependencies.
* Aim for high code coverage.
* Write clear and concise unit tests that are easy to understand and maintain.
Appendix B: End-to-End Testing with Cypress (Example)
What is End-to-End Testing?
End-to-end (E2E) tests verify that your application is working correctly from start to finish, simulating real user interactions with the UI. Cypress is a popular JavaScript-based E2E testing framework.
Benefits of End-to-End Testing:
Verifies the entire application workflow:
E2E tests ensure that all parts of your application are working together correctly.
Detects integration issues:
E2E tests can identify issues that arise when different components of your application are integrated.
Provides confidence in the application's functionality:
E2E tests give you confidence that your application is working correctly from the user's perspective.
Setting up Cypress:
1. Install Cypress: npm install cypress --save-dev
2. Open Cypress: npx cypress open
Writing a Basic Cypress Test:
  

Explanation:
describe():
Defines a test suite (a group of related tests).
it():
Defines a single test case.
cy.visit():
Visits the specified URL.
cy.get():
Selects an element on the page using a CSS selector.
cy.type():
Types text into an input field.
cy.contains():
Selects an element that contains the specified text.
should('be.visible'):
Asserts that the element is visible on the page.
Running Cypress Tests:
You can run Cypress tests in the Cypress Test Runner (GUI) or from the command line using cypress run.
Integrating Cypress with CI/CD:
Cypress can be easily integrated with CI/CD pipelines to automate the execution of E2E tests.
Key Takeaways:
* Write E2E tests to verify the entire application workflow.
* Use Cypress to write and run E2E tests.
* Integrate Cypress with your CI/CD pipeline.
* Write clear and concise E2E tests that are easy to understand and maintain.
















































Appendix C: Programming Best Practices
Introduction
Programming best practices are a set of guidelines, principles, and coding styles that experienced developers generally agree lead to higher quality, more maintainable, and more efficient software. Applying these practices can significantly improve the development process and the resulting product.
KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
The KISS principle emphasizes simplicity as a key goal in design and avoiding unnecessary complexity.
Core Idea:
Designs and implementations should be as simple as possible. Complexity should be avoided unless it is absolutely necessary.
Benefits:
* Easier to understand and maintain.
* Reduced risk of introducing bugs.
* Faster development time.
Application:
* Avoid over-engineering solutions.
* Use straightforward and easy-to-understand code.
* Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.
DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
The DRY principle states that every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.
Core Idea:
Avoid duplicating code or logic. If you find yourself repeating code, abstract it into a reusable component.
Benefits:
* Easier to maintain and update.
* Reduced risk of inconsistencies.
* Improved code readability.
Application:
* Create reusable functions or classes for common tasks.
* Use configuration files or databases to store data instead of hardcoding it.
* Abstract common logic into shared modules.
YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It)
YAGNI is a principle that states that you should not add functionality until deemed necessary.
Core Idea:
Avoid adding features or functionality that you think you might need in the future. Focus on implementing what is required for the current iteration.
Benefits:
* Reduced complexity and development time.
* Avoidance of wasted effort on features that are never used.
* More flexible and adaptable code.
Application:
* Resist the urge to add features "just in case."
* Focus on implementing the core requirements first.
* Add new features only when they are explicitly needed.
SOLID Principles
SOLID is an acronym representing five basic principles of object-oriented programming and design. They are intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job.
Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
Objects of a superclass should be able to be replaced with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program.
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
Depend upon abstractions, not concretions.
Benefits:
* Improved code organization and readability.
* Increased flexibility and maintainability.
* Reduced coupling between components.
Application:
* Carefully design classes and modules to adhere to these principles.
* Use interfaces and abstract classes to decouple components.
* Refactor code that violates these principles.
Clean Code
Clean Code is a style of programming that focuses on readability, simplicity, and maintainability.
Core Idea:
Write code that is easy to understand, modify, and extend.
Benefits:
* Improved collaboration and communication.
* Reduced debugging time.
* Lower maintenance costs.
Application:
* Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes.
* Write small, focused functions.
* Add comments to explain complex logic.
* Follow consistent coding style guidelines.
Clean Architecture
Clean Architecture is a software design philosophy that separates the concerns of a system into distinct layers, making it more maintainable, testable, and independent of frameworks, databases, and UIs.
Core Idea:
Separate the business logic of the application from the implementation details.
Benefits:
* Increased testability.
* Improved maintainability.
* Greater flexibility and adaptability.
Application:
* Organize code into layers with clear responsibilities.
* Use dependency injection to decouple components.
* Keep business logic independent of frameworks and databases.
Conclusion
By consistently applying these programming best practices, developers can create software that is not only functional but also well-designed, maintainable, and adaptable to future changes. This leads to increased productivity, reduced costs, and improved overall software quality.
Research Content Suggestion:
* Explore books like "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin, "The Pragmatic Programmer" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas, and "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides.

Appendix E: Prompt Engineering for LLMs
Introduction
Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting effective prompts for large language models (LLMs) to elicit desired responses. A well-engineered prompt can significantly improve the quality, accuracy, and relevance of the LLM's output. This appendix provides an introduction to prompt engineering techniques and best practices.
What is Prompt Engineering?
Prompt engineering involves designing and refining prompts that guide LLMs to generate specific types of content, answer questions accurately, or perform other tasks effectively. It's about understanding how LLMs interpret and respond to different types of input and leveraging that knowledge to achieve the desired outcome.
Key Principles of Effective Prompting
Be Clear and Specific
Ambiguous or vague prompts can lead to unpredictable and irrelevant responses. Clearly define the task you want the LLM to perform and provide specific instructions.
Use Proper Formatting
Structure your prompts in a way that is easy for the LLM to understand. Use clear delimiters, headings, and lists to organize information.
Provide Context
Give the LLM enough context to understand the task and generate a relevant response. This might include background information, examples, or constraints.
Specify the Desired Output Format
Tell the LLM how you want the output to be formatted. This could include specifying the length, style, tone, or structure of the response.
Prompting Techniques
Zero-Shot Prompting
This technique involves providing a prompt without any examples or demonstrations. The LLM is expected to generate the desired output based on its pre-trained knowledge.
Example:
"Translate the following English text to French: 'Hello, world!'"
Few-Shot Prompting
This technique involves providing a few examples of the desired input-output pairs in the prompt. This helps the LLM learn the task and generate more accurate responses.
Example:
"English: Hello, world! French: Bonjour, le monde!


English: How are you? French: Comment allez-vous?


English: Good morning! French:"
Chain-of-Thought Prompting
This technique encourages the LLM to break down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable steps and explain its reasoning process. This can lead to more accurate and reliable results.
Example:
"Question: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does he have now? Let's think step by step. Roger initially has 5 balls. He buys 2 cans * 3 balls/can = 6 more balls. So in total he has 5 + 6 = 11 balls. Answer: 11"
Role-Playing
Assign a specific role to the LLM and ask it to respond from that perspective. This can help to generate more creative and engaging content.
Example:
"You are a helpful and knowledgeable chatbot. A user asks: 'What is the capital of France?'"
Using Constraints
Specify constraints or limitations to guide the LLM's response. This can help to ensure that the output is relevant, appropriate, and aligned with your goals.
Example:
"Write a short poem about the ocean, but do not use any words that contain the letter 'e'."
Common Prompting Mistakes to Avoid
Vagueness
Avoid using vague or ambiguous language in your prompts. Be as specific as possible about what you want the LLM to do.
Overly Complex Prompts
Break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. Avoid trying to do too much in a single prompt.
Lack of Context
Provide enough context for the LLM to understand the task and generate a relevant response.
Ignoring the LLM's Limitations
Be aware of the LLM's limitations and avoid asking it to do things that it is not capable of.
Conclusion
Prompt engineering is a powerful tool for unlocking the full potential of LLMs. By mastering the techniques and principles outlined in this appendix, you can significantly improve the quality, accuracy, and relevance of the LLM's output and create more effective and engaging applications.
Research Content Suggestion:
* Explore different prompt engineering guides and tutorials online.

User Story 3: Backend - Message Handling and RAG + CI&T Flow Integration


* As a developer,


* I want the backend to receive messages via API endpoints, process them using RAG over loaded documents with CI&T Flow LLMs, and return the response,


* So that the user can interact with the chatbot and get relevant answers using text input as context.


Acceptance Criteria:


   * The backend receives messages from an API endpoint.
   * The backend applies the RAG technique: it creates embeddings for the user's query, retrieves relevant document chunks based on similarity, and feeds them to the LLM.
   * The backend sends the user's message and retrieved document chunks to the CI&T Flow APIs.
   * The backend receives the LLM's response from CI&T Flow.
   * The backend returns the response via an API endpoint.


Technical Notes:


   * End-to-end functionality.
   * Embedding generation with LangChain.
   * Vector store for efficient document retrieval.
   * CI&T Flow API calls with user message and context.
   * Focus: Implement the core RAG functionality and API endpoints.


User Story 4: UI - Display Chat History and Input Field


* As a user,


* I want a UI with a text input field and a chat history display above it,


* So that I can easily type messages and see the ongoing conversation.


Acceptance Criteria:


   * A UI is displayed with a text input field at the bottom.
   * A chat history area is present above the input field, capable of displaying multiple messages.
   * When the user presses Enter in the input field or clicks on the send button, the message is sent to the backend API.


Technical Notes:


   * Technology: {{Frontend Tech Stack}}.
   * Focus: Front-end development.
   * Backend: Integration with the backend API endpoints for sending messages.
   * Focus: Build the user interface and connect it to the backend API.


User Story 5: UI - Displaying Chatbot Responses


* As a user,


* I want the chatbot's responses to be displayed in the chat history,


* So that I can see the chatbot's answers to my questions.


Acceptance Criteria:


   * The UI receives the chatbot's responses from the backend API.
   * The chatbot's responses are displayed in the chat history, clearly distinguished from the user's messages.
   * The UI updates dynamically as new messages and responses are received.


Technical Notes:


   * Front-end integration with the backend API.
   * Asynchronous updates to the chat history.
   * Focus: Implement the display of chatbot responses in the UI.


User Story 6: (Optional) - Document Upload and RAG Integration


* As a user,


* I want to be able to upload documents to the chatbot, and have their content used to inform the chatbot's responses,


* So that I can provide more context to the chatbot and receive more relevant and accurate answers.


Acceptance Criteria:


   * Backend:
      * The backend can receive documents uploaded through an API endpoint.
      * The backend implements basic document parsing for uploaded documents.
      * The backend creates embeddings for the content of the uploaded document(s).
      * The backend applies the RAG technique: it creates embeddings for the user's query and the content of the uploaded document(s), retrieves relevant document chunks based on similarity, and feeds them to the LLM.
      * The backend sends the user's message, retrieved document chunks (from both pre-loaded documents and uploaded documents), to the CI&T Flow APIs.
      * The backend receives the LLM's response from CI&T Flow.
      * The backend returns the response via an API endpoint.
   * Frontend:
      * A button or drag-and-drop area is available for users to upload documents.
      * The UI displays the filename of the uploaded document before sending.
      * When the user presses Enter in the input field or clicks on the send button, the message and/or uploaded document is sent to the backend API.


Technical Notes:


   * Backend:
      * Technology: LangChain, {{Backend Tech Stack}}.
      * Document loading and parsing libraries within LangChain.
      * File upload handling logic (e.g., using a library like Flask-Uploads or similar).
      * Logic to differentiate between text input and document uploads and process them accordingly.
      * Embedding generation with LangChain.
      * Vector store for efficient document retrieval (consider how to integrate uploaded document embeddings).
